*Brainstorming Project Ideas*

### 1. (Sean Blevins) Assignment/Due Date Tracker:
User inputs a possible title and description with due date. Can send notifications to phone at different time increments where the date is x time away.

###### *Obtained Skills:* 
  - User interface.

###### *Needed Skills:* 
  - Notifications (to sleeping phone), time/date representation (calendar?).

### 2. (Roslyn Parker) Tic-Tac-Toe: 
A user can select what x and o "icon" they want, and then they can select if they want to play with a friend (two users for one device)
or against the computer. There would be 3 levels of diffuculty against a computer, easy(random), medium(random + sometimes best choice), 
and hard (always best choice by ai).

###### *Obtained Skills:* 
  - Implementing multiple activities.
  
###### *Needed Skills:* 
  - Images/Icons.

### 3. (James Kilgus) Live Mapping Program: 
Using the google maps API and geolocation, users would be able to generate a map on the fly that only maps places they have been. Places they have not yet visited are still black and unmapped. This may be possible to do using the mask function although it may be way too difficult so we will have to see. Essentially you would apply a black 'mask' layer to everywhere you haven't visited yet. You could set a certain size block and say map by square mile or something like that. So if you entered a new square mile the whole thing would then instantly be mapped in your map which would be tied to your user id. Each user would have their own map of just where they've been.

### 4. Extra Visual Sense
Human vision sees a relatively narrow portion of the color spectrum. Our phones may be able to see farther into the infrared and ultraviolet regions than we can. If we could somehow filter these color spaces from the camera and then shift them into a spectrum that we can see, we could have a some way of extending our visual sense. I don't know if this is possible either but this is just brainstorming so we will have to look into it
