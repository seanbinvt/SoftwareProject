*Brainstorming Project Ideas*

### 1. (Sean Blevins) Assignment/Due Date Tracker:
User inputs a possible title and description with due date. Can send notifications to phone at different time increments where the date is x time away.

###### *Obtained Skills:* 
  - User interface.

###### *Needed Skills:* 
  - Notifications (to sleeping phone), time/date representation (calendar?).

### 2. (Roslyn Parker) Tic-Tac-Toe: 
A user can select what x and o "icon" they want, and then they can select if they want to play with a friend (two users for one device)
or against the computer. There would be 3 levels of diffuculty against a computer, easy(random), medium(random + sometimes best choice), 
and hard (always best choice by ai). We know how to implement multiply activities, and most of the ropes, but we don't know how to implement images or "icons".
